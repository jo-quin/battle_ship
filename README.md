# Battle_ship

An online CLI BattleShip game.

My main motivation to create this CLI replica of the BattleShip game was to learn how to connect different users on different networks to play against each other online. The app is hosted on a Raspberry Pi computer connected to the internet where users can connect to via Telnet.

## Usage

To play the game visit ```telnet jo-quin.tech 2979```

To exit the game at any time press Ctrl+] and press enter. When the prompt appears type `close`. This will close the connection with the server.
